            <p class="article1-body">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
                standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it
                to make a type specimetially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
                sheets containing  Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
                PageMaker including versions of Lorem IpsumIpsumIt has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
                typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
                sheets containing  Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
                PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. </p>
